/**
 * UI to lock the underlying component. Extends {@link LockableUI} to counts the number of invocations to lock and it ensure it is unlocked as many times for the locked effect to
 * be removed, i.e. if there are 2 requests to lock it there must be 2 requests to unlock it for the locked effect to disappear. Any time a request is made to lock there should be
 * a matching request to unlock when processing is complete.
 * <p>
 * NB. The API to lock/unlock is {@link #lockRequest(boolean)}, normally for a Unlike {@link LockableUI} it would be {@link #setLocked(boolean)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Lock the UI by locking the cursor. This can serve as a direct replacement for the Trumps {@link CursorManager}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Do not use this class directly, use it through {@link BusyLayerService} which provides convenience and ensures proper synchronisation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implemented as an extension of the JXLayer {@link LockableUI} so that it should be compatible with WaitLayerUI that will be available in Java 7.
