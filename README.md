==========

Java Swing stuff.

Highlights:

Busy layer built on JXLayer.

Images support (enum that lazy loads images, has a matching test that ensure the images exist).

Developed on Java 6, as yet it is not guaranteed to compile or work for any other version.
Developed using Eclipse with Maven (m2eclipse).
